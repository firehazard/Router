I'm using the reference version of STCP... though I'm submitting my version of transport.c as well since I
believe it works fine (I guess I just wanted to reduce the risk of a bug I haven't seen by using one free 
binary). 
I'm using my version of the proxy and the router.

I havent made any extra additions.



Thanks,
Tom
